#Complete Responsive Portfolio Website

##Introduction
This web app is primarily for informative or entertainment purposes but can also be used for personal career marketing (Therefore, I decided to add a few lists of my personal skills, experience, CV and social links), social networking with other people with shared interests, or as a space for personal expression. My project helps to promote career at all levels due to direct social access links provided to bridge the gap between client and customers. It is rightly said that knowledge is power and that information is key. Wherefore I focused on 2 things: creating an experience that would be both web and mobile-friendly, and also sourcing a reliable and sophisticated API you would appreciate.

For the Frontend I chose to use HTML5, CSS3 and the Backend JavaScript without any additional frameworks. I opted not to use other frameworks because I wanted to dedicate my time to solidifying my understanding of JavaScript. The website is responsive and compatible with mobile. This means users can access the project from a mobile view as well as using the desktop. You can view the web app and also send a message through the provided space for clients who wish to comment or make their suggestions through the provided contact space where few of their details are demanded as a requirement, Or a direct message could be initiated through the social links provided at the home page.

##Antipated Project 
In my next moves, I’m considering building a unique app that is directly related to the Maritime industry as an Engineer with relative experience in the Maritime sector to solve problems of ships being hijacked, tracking software devices to aid ships navigational systems with the assistance of a GPRS exetera.
